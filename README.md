## Project Overview
The process of tracking popular and top sales products is important for merchants to make selling decisions. The merchants have to manually tracking these products and prices which required a lot of afford and time-consuming. 

Thus, we will create a Python script that can perform web scraping to extract and collect data on e-commerce website. Expected data that will be collected include product image, name, price, product sold and link of the product. It will extract the data automatically in an efficient and fast way. By using web scraping, merchants can easily know the most popular and prices of the products.
